Interview question could come up like
```
Terminology: What is Hub & Spoke architecture ? (its not a cloud service, a geneneral terminology)

WHY Firewall? / How it works?
Firewall is placed in front of our infrastructure, its like a gate of a society where all the scanning is done, of a incoming and outgoing traffic, it to the all infrastructure, be it physical, on-prem or virtual or cloud, where ever the infrastructure at be, Firewall will always be the main component.

and on Firewall level we can configure security for entire Infrastructure

All the connection will be connect to our firewall, 

Lets say we have two internet connections, 1st connection is gone to WAN1 and 2nd connection to WAN2

`Whatever traffic coming from internet is getting redireted to the WAN`

WAN ports we need to configure with public IP, and ISP is going to provide the public IP.
WAN Port every time we need to configure with Public IP

LAN ports are at the latter slot ports, (no. of LAN and WAN ports depends on the firewall model we're choosing)

DMZ is segrigated infrastructure, Demilitarized Zone (It's a subnetwork that separates an organization's internal network (LAN) from external, untrusted networks like the internet, providing an extra layer of security. )

LAN Port is getting configured with Private IP 

And the LAN port is getting configured with **Network Switch**


Traffic we get from outside -> gets collected to WLAN -> And the traffic is redirected from WAN port to LAN port -> LAN port will be responsible now to establish the communication into Backend Infra
