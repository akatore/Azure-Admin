Interview question could come up like
```
Terminology: What is Hub & Spoke architecture ? (its not a cloud service, a geneneral terminology)
```

# WHY Firewall?
Firewall is placed in front of our infrastructure, its like a gate of a society where all the scanning is done, of a incoming and outgoing traffic, it to the all infrastructure, be it physical, on-prem or virtual or cloud, where ever the infrastructure at be, Firewall will always be the main component.

and on Firewall level we can configure security for entire Infrastructure 

### Fortinet's Firewall

All the connection will be connect to our firewall, 

Lets say we have two internet connections, 1st connection is gone to WAN1 and 2nd connection to WAN2

`Whatever traffic coming from internet is getting redireted to the WAN`

WAN ports we need to configure with public IP, and ISP is going to provide the public IP.
WAN Port every time we need to configure with Public IP

LAN ports are at the latter slot ports, (no. of LAN and WAN ports depends on the firewall model we're choosing)

DMZ is segrigated infrastructure, Demilitarized Zone (It's a subnetwork that separates an organization's internal network (LAN) from external, untrusted networks like the internet, providing an extra layer of security. )

LAN Port is getting configured with Private IP 

And the LAN port is getting configured with **Network Switch**


Traffic we get from outside -> gets collected to WLAN -> And the traffic is redirected from WAN port to LAN port -> LAN port will be responsible now to establish the communication into Backend Infra


# Firewall On Azure Cloud
1. **Azure Firewall Service** - PAAS or Serverless Firewall (1st scenario)
   - **DNAT** Rule
   - **Network** Rule
   - **App** Rule
`Fact:  when we create a Firewall using Azure Firewall Service, in the backend MicroSoft deploys a VM that manages the Firewall, this VM is managed by Microsoft as the service used for creation is PAAS/Serverless.`
for this firewall creation no lisence is required as everything is managed by MS

2. ThirdParty Firewall on Azure (2st scenario)
   example - Cisco / Fortinet / PaloAlto / Sonicwall
   The moment we use these ThirdParty Firewall, a Azure VM gets created and that we need to manage.
   So we need to manage the firewall console and we also need to manage the VM, and inside the VM there's a Firewall OS - based of Linux (example Forti OS)
```
 firewall runs inside the VM machine
```

Two types of Licenses.
- Pay As You GO (PAYG)
- Bring Your Own Licenses(BYOL).

The firewall that you deploy on the cloud is virtual firewall not the physical firewall.

# HOW Azure Firewall works

Network name -> fe-vent 
- CIDR : 172.30.0.0/16

Segregate the Vnet into two subnets, and under these subnets we are going to deploy the firewall.

Subnetwork ->
1. AzureFirewallSubnet (sort of frontend subnet)
   - CIDR: 172.30.1.0/24
2. AzureFirewallManagementSubnet (sort of backend subnet as it used for management, Azure firewall manager ke under)
   - CIDR: 172.30.2.0/24
  
----
Lets understand how Azure Firewall Works,

We are going to deploy a firwall into first Subnet, 
During Azure Firewall Service deloyment, MicroSoft configurs two ports
1. WAN port - Public IP
   - All the traffic comming from the internet/outside will be redirected to the WAN port only.
2. LAN port - Private IP - (172.30.1.4) (why not 172.30.1,*.2,*.3 or *.255? because they are booked and are not available)
   - Private IP will be taken form the subnet we deployed our Azure Firewall Service on.

2nd Subnet is just for management so the firewall we deployed will also be connected to the 2nd subnet just for management purpose.

So fe-vent was deployed as frontend network, and this will be peered with backend networks, which would be, Devlopment, Prod, Qa, and multiple such networks. And all these network will be peered with our fe-vent (frontend network).

And that's why Vnet-peering comes in picture

`traffic hits fe-vent -> from fe-vent to multiple  backend networks`


Doubt by one guy, that how these backend network will talk via internal networks, (spokes)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f59108df-f5d3-40c2-917f-e3146b8be996)

Spokes inorder to talk to each other need to go via firewall, how? it'll go from LAN (private IP) (in fe-Vnet via peering) and then to other spoke .
